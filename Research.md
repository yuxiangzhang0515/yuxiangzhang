# Research
As a PhD candidate, my research primarily explores intersections within Food Policy, Food Marketing, and Consumer Behavior, aiming to understand how marketing strategies and policy decisions influence consumer choices and market trends. In addition, my secondary focus delves into Empirical Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics, where I apply quantitative methods to address complex problems in these fields.
